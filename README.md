# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Regression Models

## 🎯 Objective
This project aims to apply multiple regression models to predict car prices based on various features.

We will:
- Load and preprocess the dataset 📂
- Implement five regression models 🏗️
- Evaluate model performance 📊
- Identify important features 🔍
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy 🎯

## 🏁 Conclusion

- The best-performing model is identified based on R² Score and error metrics.
- Feature importance highlights key factors affecting car prices.
- Hyperparameter tuning improves model accuracy.

This project demonstrates how various regression techniques can be used for price prediction, with practical insights into model performance and optimization! 🚀
